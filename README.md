# PigGame
Pig Game code

Task: Write a program that plays the Pig Game.

The application declares and initializes variables for the user's and computer's scores before creating the Scanner object to take user input.
We utilized the Random class to make the computer's decision random.
We used System.out.print to produce a welcome message.
After the user rolls the die, the computer selects one at random. The game's rules are then applied by the computer to determine the round's winner.
After each round is complete, the program prints the final results and asks the user if they want to keep playing.
